# Obviously the above will fail when there are multiple **overlapping** pairs, but at low temperatures it should give us a decent estimate.
#
# In terms of an analytic expectation, I'm really not sure. Recalling that particles are generated from the GS by creating blue spin-down strings, we should seek to minimise these strings and therefore increase the number of particles which exist in pairs.
